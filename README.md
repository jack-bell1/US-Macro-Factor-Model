# US-Macro-Factor-Model

### Motivations:
Inspired by [Two Sigma Factor Lens](https://www.twosigma.com/articles/thematic-research-introducing-the-two-sigma-factor-lens), which models broad macro risk drivers to reduce correlation and improve portfolio construction. The paper uses tradeable proxies to enable a portfolio construction from the factor model. However, my approach will be slightly different.


### Project goals:
Build a factor model to represent major US macro risks. Use it to detect market regimes for better trading signals. Market regimes are purely statistical methods to identify whether or not we are in a BULL / BEAR / SIDEWAYS market. Perhaps there are more than these regimes in the market; we will explore this after we have constructed our factor model.

### Factor Structure:
- Core Factors: Dominant macro drivers explaining most variance across asset classes. 
- Secondary Factors: Specialized risks with smaller, but still meaningful, influence.


| Factor            | Type       | Proxy Ticker(s) | Description                                | Inception Date |
|-------------------|------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------|
| US Equity (Target)| Core       | SPY             | S&P 500 ETF                                | 1993           |
| Interest Rates    | Core       | IEF             | 7â€“10 Year US Treasury Bonds                | 2002           |
| Credit            | Core       | LQD, HYG        | IG & High Yield Credit                     | 2002 / 2007    |
| Commodities       | Core       | DBC             | Broad Commodities Index ETF                | 2006           |
| USD FX Strength   | Secondary  | UUP             | US Dollar Index ETF                        | 2007           |
| Local Inflation   | Secondary  | TIP             | US TIPS ETF                                | 2003           |


### Factor motivations : 
- US Equity: The dependent variable, we want to predict regimes inside this proxy, so this factor will be used as a reference.
- We are using the other factors to interpret SPY's behaviour - this will become apparent in the correlation analysis

Note: Our data must begin in 2007 due to the inception of our UUP and HYG proxies; unfortunately, I was not able to find any data that would provide a representation of these factors with an earlier date. 

Correlated factors like Credit or Commodities will be residualized against Equity/Interest Rates to isolate pure exposures using simple regression models. 

### Methodology - Why a simple regression Model?

I will not be using any more complex models such as ARIMA, SARIMAX, LSTM, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, etc. This is because our goal is not to capture variance using the model, but instead to extract the residuals from each regression we do. 

In layman's terms, we are not looking to predict with this model; instead, we are looking to explain.

By design, this means we are technically violating Gauss-Markov assumptions as we are purposefully looking for exogeneity, so that we can extract it. This would mean our residual extraction will have noise, but I am assuming it isn't very important. In financial time series, we often find that the assumptions are generally violated, resulting in heteroskedastic residuals. Depending on the data used, we are likely to encounter serial correlation. 



## TL;DR:
Built a macro factor model using tradeable proxies and residualized exposures, which will be extracted as a feature set to statistically identify US market regimes (bull, bear, sideways) for trading signal generation.

# Sample Results:
## Regression Results:
#### Rolling R-Squared for all factors on US Equity:
After making the EW rolling OLS regression, I plotted the rolling $R^2$ across the time series to get a feel for how the model performed. Note that we do have autocorrelation and heteroskedastic residuals, so by Gauss-Markov, OLS here is not BLUE, but it is the best thing we have. This was completed for each factor, where we had average rolling $R^2$ values of at least 0.65, except for the USD Strength and Commodities Factors, which I imagine have more global exposures. 
Two Sigma made their model represent global markets, where they included aspects such as Emerging Markets (EM) factors. I would imagine they would have a stronger fit in this area by using these external features.

## PCA Results
I ran PCA, hoping to reduce the size of the feature set. I have 7 factors,
